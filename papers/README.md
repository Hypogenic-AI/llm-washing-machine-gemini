1.  **Toy Models of Superposition** (2209.10652v1_Toy_Models_of_Superposition.pdf)
    *   **Relevance:** Foundational paper on how models represent more features than they have dimensions (superposition) and polysemanticity. Essential for understanding if "washing machine" is a superposition or a distinct feature.

2.  **Funny or Persuasive, but Not Both: Evaluating Fine-Grained Multi-Concept Control in LLMs** (2601.18483v1_Funny_or_Persuasive,_but_Not_Both:_Evaluating_Fine.pdf)
    *   **Relevance:** investigating fine-grained concept control and compositionality limitations.

3.  **Exploring Multilingual Concepts of Human Values in Large Language Models** (2402.18120v3_Exploring_Multilingual_Concepts_of_Human_Values_in.pdf)
    *   **Relevance:** empirical confirmation of linear representation of concepts, though focused on values.

4.  **Tackling Polysemanticity with Neuron Embeddings** (2411.08166v1_Polysemanticity.pdf)
    *   **Relevance:** methodologies for handling polysemantic neurons, relevant to "washing machine" potentially being polysemantic.
