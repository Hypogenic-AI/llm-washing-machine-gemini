  title: Where is Washing Machine stored in LLMs?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'In large language models, individual concepts such as ''washing machine''
    may not be represented by distinct or orthogonal directions in the residual stream;
    instead, the model may store more atomic concepts like ''washing'', with the presence
    of ''machine'' increasing the likelihood of the composite concept.

    '
  background:
    description: There are too many referenceable things for each to have a direction,
      or even a 'nearly orthogonal' direction in the residual stream. Where is 'washing
      machine' stored in LLMs? Or is just 'washing' stored and then it's assumed that
      machine becomes more likely?
